# WEB MOVIE RECOMMENDATIONS

One of recommender system i built was using streamlit and google colab to build that model, you all can be recommended with this website. Technology i use is cosine-similarity from sklearn's library. This will help you to find movies that are similar to what movie you're looking for

Let's have a look at some codes that might help you out to build recommender system
